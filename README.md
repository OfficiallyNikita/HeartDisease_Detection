<p>
This project is part of my Data Analytics Course Assignment at Growth School.  
It focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters using **Logistic Regression**.  

The dataset is sourced from **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**, and the model has been built following standard Machine Learning practices.

##  Project Overview
 **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features  
 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding feature distributions and correlations  
 **Machine Learning Model**: Implemented **Logistic Regression** for classification  
 **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC score  
 **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Improved model performance with optimized parameters  

This project helped me understand the **practical application of AI & ML in healthcare analytics** while refining my skills in **Python, data analysis, and model optimization**.
